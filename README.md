# CLM's Plaque Program
CRC of the Quarter 
##Purpose
To create a user friendly applicaiton for creating the CRC of the quarter, based on photo's and inputs chosen by the user. The template should be exactly the same as the old version.

###Roadmap
1. To define the labs, and the employees within them.
2. To define naming conventions for photos.
3. To link the employees with their respective photos.
4. The ability to place these linked objects and place them in a .docx file, with name and photo.
5. The ability to format the .docx properly.
6. To save the output as a .pdf file for each lab.

####Notes
* The roadmap is still up for determination, and nothing is set in stone. Ask on the Trello card if you have a special request.
* The roadmap also implicitly includes several sub-goals. These will be added as we encounter them.

The reference to the correctly output sheet will look as such.
